# Hindi-character-recognition
In this work, we propose a technique to recognize handwritten Hindicharacters using deep learning approaches like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) With Optimizer RMSprop (Root MeanSquare Propagation) , Adaptive Moment (Adam) Estimation and Keras Model.
Real time hindi characters recognition is
an innovative project that aims to develop
a system for recognizing handwritten
characters in the Devanagari script.

Handwritten character recognition has
been a challenging problem in the field of
computer vision and machine learning for
many years.

This project builds upon previous research
in the field of handwritten character
recognition and aims to develop a system
specifically for recognizing Devanagari
characters.
